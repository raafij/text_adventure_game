# Text Adventure Development Game

I have developed a game based on Jumanji, the movie, featuring Kevin Hart and Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson. This game features user inputs based on their decisions in order to advance in the game. There are three stages until the end of the game. Play now to find out if you get eaten by a hippo or survive the shooting from the troops!

## Assignment Instructions:

This game should utilize the Python essentials covered thus far, including, but not limited to:

1. Strings and String Manipulation
2. User-Defined Functions and Objects (variables)
3. User Input and Input Handling
4. Conditional and Nested Conditional Statements (if/elif/else)
5. Loops (for/while)
6. Controlling for Errors
